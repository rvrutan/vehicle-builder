Vehicle Builder CLI

Description

This is a TypeScript command-line application that allows users to build and manage different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorbikes. The application prompts users to either create a new vehicle or select an existing one. Once a vehicle is selected, users can perform various actions with it. The program is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles using TypeScript.
